# SolGate

SolGate is a programmable HTTP 402 payment layer that routes usage revenue into configurable buybacks — turning real product usage into measurable buy pressure.

- No transfer tax (fees apply only to paid requests)
- Configurable fee basis points
- Vault routing for buybacks
- Designed for transparent receipts
